## Basic Searching

A basic keyword search is available on the landing page. Enter the text you want to search on and press 'enter' or click the
magnifying glass to the right of the search bar. If you would like to see all of our parts just click the magnifying glass
without typing anything in the search bar.

## Filtering a Basic Search

In order to help narrow down the parts you are looking for you can use filters.

### Search Options

Search options are available on the landing page as well as the **Search Results** page. If you click the arrow to the left of
the search bar, you will see a drop down menu. The top part of the menu allows you to choose which fields the keyword search
works on. For example, if you just wanted parts with `blue` in the title, you could type blue in the search bar and select
only the 'Name' search option.

### Entry Types

If you are looking for a certain entry types, you can select one in the drop down menu. If you click the arrow to the right
of the search bar, you will see the bottom section of the drop down is titled 'Entry Types'. These are all of the types of
satellite parts we have. You can search for a specific type by selecting one and then typing something into the search bar.

### Filtering Search Results

Once you do a search, you will be redirected to the **Search Results** page. This page lets you see the results of
your search as well as view individual parts, filter your results, and do new searches. In order to filter your search, click
the funnel button on the top left of the page. A sidebar will become visible. This will allow you to pick a certain category,
tag, organization or attribute. Filtering on any of these fields will return parts that match all of selected filters exactly.

## Contact Us

You can contact SPOON support through the menu on the top right of the window. Click the menu button (the three
horizontal lines) and select 'Contact'. This will take you to a screen that will allow you to send SPOON support
