1. Sign up, if you haven't already. You will need to fill in your information first, then select "GET VERIFICATION CODE", which will create your account and send a confirmation email to your stated email address. You will not be able to login to Spoon until you click the confirmation link sent in the email. If you did not receive an email, then your email's spam box. You can click "GET VERIFICATION CODE" repeatedly to get another confirmation email if you did not find the first one. If you still cannot find the email, you must send a message to the Spoon support team ***through Spoon's Contact Us form***. See below for more details.

1. If you cannot receive the confirmation email then you must contact the Spoon support team via the on-site Contact Us form, in order to work around any potential issues that might have arisen due an email connection problem. Spoon Support will attempt to contact you back via email to help you setup an account on Spoon.
