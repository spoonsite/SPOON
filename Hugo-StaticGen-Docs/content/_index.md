# SPOON Documentation

SPOON (SmallSat Parts On Orbit Now) is cataloging system used to catalog small satelite parts. Users can search parts by user defined tags, attributes such as mass or diameter, category type such as propulsion or power, and organization. SPOON also provides the ability for vendors to input parts into the database.

See [spoonsite.github.io](https://spoonsite.github.io) for documentation on the latest release.

SPOON was initially developed as [Openstorefront for DI2E](https://github.com/di2e/openstorefront). This documentation uses SPOON, Storefront, and Openstorefront interchangeably.
