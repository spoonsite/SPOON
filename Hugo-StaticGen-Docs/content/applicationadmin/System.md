The System Page provides information about the system SPOON is running on like memory usage, cache management, and error logs.

Note that on this page, and every sub-page of the System page, the "Refresh" button <img src="/images/AppAdmin/RefreshButton.png" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px" /> does nothing but send a new request to the server for the sub-page displayed - it does not edit or 'refresh' any data object selected at the time.

On the left three sub-sub-tab options can be seen:

1. On the first page the Admin lands on the "**Status**" page, where environment variables are displayed. The "**Automatically Update: Yes / No**" switch at the top of the sub-page automatically updates the page every 2 seconds.

2. Threads Status:
   Every incoming request to the server is received by a thread, and here the operational status of each one is visible; "**View**" shows an extended log
3. System Properties
   A list of non-editable properties relating to the java environment (version 8) and server (Tomcat).

### Error Tickets

All errors in SPOON are tracked and can be found in the Error Tickets page. If an error does occur, a SPOON user can get an error that looks like this:

![Example SPOON Error](/images/AppAdmin/submitError.JPG)

Then, a full stack trace of the error that was thrown in that incident will be viewable here. This log is primarily for the stack trace from errors of the severity that they are reported to regular users. For a more comprehensive error log, see the [Logs and Logging](/applicationadmin/system/#logs-and-logging) sub-page. The "**View Details**" button gives us the stack trace, where places where the traces goes through SPOON's files is highlighted in yellow. This is helpful for developers who need to recreate a bug.

### Application State Properties

A list of editable configuration settings for the application.

### System Configuration Properties

A list of editable configuration settings for the application. This page is more valuable to the Systems Admin, but the Application Admin may find use in the settings here related to setting up the mail server, for email.

### Logs and Logging

1. Logger Levels
   SPOON's codebase is in Java, and Java encapsulates groups of files with related purposes into what are known as 'packages'. Here all the Java packages are displayed, and the Admin has the ability to adjust how verbose the logs generated by each one are. Select a package and click edit to see the verbosity levels that it can be set to.

2. Logs
   Logs generated by the site. Files in the stack trace that are part of SPOON's codebase are enlarged for emphasis to the person watching.
   The "**Database Logger**" switch, as the name implies, toggles logging on or off on the server.

### Plugins

SPOON uses [OSGi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) for it's plugin capabilities. If there is a need for a plugin, there is an example plugin that can be used as a template in the openstorefront/openstorefront-plugin project.

### Cache

SPOON is equipped with caching to increase the speed of the application. When adding information to SPOON the caches may not be getting updated. If this is the case, it may be required to flush the cache and ensure that all caches are up to date.

### Search Control

"**Re-index Listings**" updates Elasticsearch with all approved and active parts from the database. This will take around a minute per 1500 entries. You must re-index when starting SPOON, updating Elasticsearch, or restarting Elasticsearch. If this is not done, searching will not work.

### Recent Changes Email

This sub-page will enable you to send to yourself a simple email noting the number of Components (SPOON parts) that have been touched/edited by either the system or a user within the time range specified by you. Touches by the system could include anything from a Admin user using the Admin Tools>Data Management>Entries page to open and edit a Component, or the server moving Components in the database without user supervision.

In SPOON v2.11, the interval between emails is set in configuration files to be every 28 days. If you need to edit this setting, you will have to manually change the config file at `server\openstorefront\openstorefront-core\common\src\main\java\edu\usu\sdl\openstorefront\common\util\OpenStorefrontConstant.java` . There is no user interface for this particular setting.

Contact your System Admin if you need further support.

### Managers

Managers are Java services, or more specifically, Java singleton objects that are responsible for serving up data to the application. You can safely "**Restart**" Managers to try and fix odd behavior on the site (should you need it). "**Stop**\ing" a Manager is dangerous, because every Manager is integral to running some or another part of the site.

### Heap Memory

You can see more about what heap memory is at [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html)

### Memory Pools

For more information on how Java handles memory, see [https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/memory.htm#CNCPT007](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/memory.htm#CNCPT007)

### Garbage Collection
