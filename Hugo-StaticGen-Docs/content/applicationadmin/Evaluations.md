## Evaluations
Evaluations are an assessment on Spoon's entries. There is a hierarchy of dependencies - Evaluation Templates need a Section Template and a Checklist Template, and a Checklist Template needs a Checklist Questions object. So if the Admin is making an evaluation form for the very first time, he/she will need to first create a Checklist Question, then a Checklist Template, then a Section Template.

### 1 - Primary Menu
Here you can see all the previously saved evaluation on parts inside of Spoon. Do note that evaluations can only be created, as assigned to users by, the Admin; there is no way for a regular user on Spoon to make an evaluation on a part by themselves. 

You can assign Evaluations to complete to other users (the Admin will see the option to do this when they click "__Add__").
