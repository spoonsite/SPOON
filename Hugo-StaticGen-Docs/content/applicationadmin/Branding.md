{{% notice warning %}}
When updating or changing branding, you must toggle it back on. When a branding is created or edited it is automatically turned off. A branding is active only if the status column has an "A" in it or if the name has "active" next to it.

## The Branding Form

### General

Be aware of the fact that text color is preserved from the input boxes on this page to the destinations of the content. For example, if the Admin entered black text in the **Landing Page Footer** input box, then the text would be black where it appears in the landing page’s footer. This is true even if the background color of the landing page’s footer is already a dark color that does not contrast well with black text. For this reason it is wise to coordinate the site’s colors that are set in the **Colors/Logos** tab with the font color set in the **General Branding** tab.

{{% notice info %}}
This can lead to a mistake if one Admin makes the text of the contents of one of the input boxes white, which would make that text box appear to another Admin to be completely empty, even though there is white text inside (with no contrast against the white background).
{{% /notice %}}

If the Admin knows HTML/CSS, they can insert custom language by selecting the **Source Edit** option on the input boxes:

The **Show link to mobile site in menu** checkbox does nothing in SPOON v2.11.

### Login Page

Here you can set the content seen on the login page.

### Support

In this section you are able to set your feedback handing method, such as email or internal storage.

{{% notice note %}}
JIRA is a selection in the dropdown but support has been dropped for JIRA integration in V2.11.
{{% /notice %}}

You are also able to add a analytics tracking code, as to learn more about what your user are doing on the site.

### Security

There are instances when the SPOON Admin might need to gain the attention of every current SPOON user—for example, if SPOON experienced a security breach that threatened SPOON users while a security patch was being applied. In these cases, the Admin can quickly create a custom text message that is visible at the top of all the pages on the legacy site.

![Security Banner](/images/AppAdmin/SecurityBanner.png)

Putting any text in the **Security Banner Text** input box will turn on the banner, and to remove, delete all text within the box. Do note that as of v2.11, the front page will not show the warning banner. If you are having difficulty turning off the banner, be sure to check if the input box is truly clear by using the **Source Edit** button in the toolbar.

One of the uses for the **User Input Warning** is at the top of the form that users use to make a new part submission.

To learn more about Change Requests, see [Workplans](/applicationadmin/workplans/).

### Colors/Logos

In SPOON v2.11, there are two separate web technologies that are managing the user interface: Ext.js and Vue.js. Each has a different way of handling where colors are displayed, so the best way to get a consistent theme across both flavors is experimentation.

For Admins who know CSS, it is possible to add custom styles to the CSS page included.

### Current CSS

A read-only CSS file that shows, in one place, all the CSS generated by the options set in this branding.
