# 1. Internal Development

See [User Interface Guide](/dev/uiguide), [Server Code Standard](/dev/server-code-standard), and [Front-end Code Standards](/dev/front-end-code-standard) for Coding and Style guides.

## 1.1 Key Components Used
 
The following components were used in the development:

-   JDK 8

-   Elasticsearch/Solr

-   OpenAM (Configurable, default is property based log in.)

The application is a JEE servlet-container webapp, so any JEE 6 servlet-container
compliant server should work with some server configuration. The current
deployment target is Tomcat 7.


## 1.2 Key Libraries Used

The following key libraries were used in the development:

-   JAX-RS- heavily used for REST API. (Jersey with Moxy for
    data binding)

-   Stripes- Action based web framework

-   Jackson- JSON Handling/Binding

-   Apache Shiro- Security

-   Orient DB- No SQL/Multi-Model database

-   Ext.js and tinymce

## 1.3 Dev Environment with NetBeans

1. Install openjdk 8
    - Windows: https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild
    - Linux: ```sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk```

1. Install netbeans 8.2 Java EE version
    - https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/
    - Run the installer, and during install don't checkbox either server box (glassfish or tomcat)
        * Point netbeans to the openjdk 8 installation path
            * Windows: "C:\Program Files\ojdkbuild\java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.222-2"
            * Linux: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/

1. Download tomcat 7.0.96 binaries from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
    - Unpack tomcat

1. Download elasticsearch 7.2.1 from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-2-1
    - Once it is downloaded you need to unpack elasticsearch
    - Inside the bin folder of elasticsearch you need to find and edit the elasticsearch file. 
        * It is a .bat file for Windows
        * For Linux is is a shell file
    - At the top of this file, you need to add the following line
        * Windows: set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\ojdkbuild\java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.222-2
        * Linux: JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
    - Now start up elasticsearch by double clicking on the file that was just modified.

1. Download the latest maven 3.6 binaries from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
    - Unpack maven

1. Clone the project from where ever it is located
    - clone project
    - For example `git clone https://github.com/spoonsite/SPOON.git`

1. Start netbeans
    - netbeans > tools > options > java > maven > maven Home > "Point to maven folder downloaded from above" > apply > OK
    - netbeans > services > servers > add server > apache tomcat or tomEE > next > "Point to downloaded tomcat" > " Set user name and password = 1" > finish
    - netbeans > services > "just created server" > properties > Platform > VM Options > "-Xms8G -Dapplication.datadir=E:/SPOON_PROJECT_DATA"
    - netbeans > File > open project > "cloned project" > Open Project > spoon_Directory=>server_Directory=>openstorefront > Open Required Projects > Open Project
    - Resolve Problems > "Resolve each problem until all green." >> Close
  
1. Back in netbeans we need to clean the top level openstorefront project in the projects tab,(right click) then build with dependencies.(right-click)
    - Once that is completed(it can take several minutes the first time.)
    - run the openstorefront-web project

1. Start up a web browser, navigate to localhost:8080/openstorefront
    - login as an admin
    - Go to local Admin -> Admin Tools
    - Application Management -> System
    - Search Control -> Re-Index Listings
    - You may have to run the re-indexer twice.

1. Finally we can start up a dev server for developing front end stuff.
    - In a terminal navigate to the spoon project and step into the client=>desktop folder
    - Run: ```npm install```
    - Then run: ```npm run serve```


## 1.4 Dev Environment with Visual Studio Code

1. **VS Code Install/configuration**
  * Install Visual Studio Code  - https://code.visualstudio.com
     * Read this page to get a walk through of how to setup VS code for Java Development https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java
     * Get familiar with VS Code by watching the quick videos about it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos
2. Install the Java 8 EE SDK found here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/index.html
3. Install Apache Maven here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
4. Install Tomcat here:  https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi
5. Once you have VS Code installed and the other dependent applications you will need to install the VS Code extensions and configure them reading their install pages and how paths are set to point to the applications.
    * Java Extension Pack by Red Hat. This includes several extensions for Java Development
    * Tomcat Extension
    * Maven for Java Extension
6. **Clone the openstorefront GitHub repo to the desired directory**
  * https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/
7. **Open the openstorefront Project**
  * Select the Open Folder Menu in VS Code or press Ctrl-K Ctrl-O. You can also go to File->Add Folder to Workspace
  * Open the openstorefront folder to be added. You will notice git is integrated with VS Code to see files that are changing.
8. **Open Maven Extension with openstorefont drop down**
    * You will likely need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable and java and maven paths to the windows PATH system variables. 
    * Right mouse click on the openstorefront package in the maven extension and click the install button to build the project. 
9. **After the build completes use the Tomcat Extension**
    * The tomcat extension allows you to select where Tomcat is installed. You should also set where the tomcat web folder is located in the settings. The extension will create a new folder structure. "tomcat.workspace": "F:\\sf"
    * Read the configuration information on the extension. 
    * I had problems getting the the .war file to copy to the running tomcat instance so I had to use another extension to perform the copy. With the tomcat workspace defined you can now setup a copy script from maven build for the war file or you can use a copy file VSCode extension to copy the war file to the correct location. If tomcat is running it will unpack the war file and you should be able to access the running application in your browser at localhost://8080/openstorefront.  

## 1.5 Building with Maven CLI

Install Maven if not installed by your IDE - http://maven.apache.org/install.html

run `mvn install` from `$PROJECT\_HOME/server/openstorefront`

(Skip tests) `mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true` or `mvn -DskipTests=true install`


## 1.6 Deploying

Copy the war artifact to the webapp directory for Tomcat. Some IDEs can
handle this for you. See application server documentation for other deployment
mechanisms.

## 1.7  Running

The application is targeted to run in Tomcat 7; however, it may run in
other compatible containers with little or no changes.

{{% notice note %}}
Searching requires an external Elasticsearch/(Solr) instance setup.
See [Setup](/systemadmin/setup/)
{{% /notice %}}


## 1.8 Testing

-   Unit tests
  * run as part of the Maven install.
  * NetBeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea have native graphical test runners built in.
  * with the JUnit CLI java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore [class to test] http://junit.org/junit4/faq.html#atests_1
-   Container/Integration tests login as admin go to
    <http://localhost:8080/openstorefront/test/ServiceTest.action>


## 1.9  Contributing Patches

The code is hosted on the public GitHub
[https://github.com/di2e/openstorefront](<https://github.com/di2e/openstorefront>). Create a pull request to the
current release branch. A pull request will be reviewed prior to merge.
Please file bugs or enhancement by submitting a ticket to:

<https://jira.di2e.net/browse/STORE> (Login required)

If you are unable to obtain a login account then submit an issue ticket
on the GitHub site.

## 1.10 Versioning Strategy

The software is versioned based on the following:

Major.Minor.Patch

A major version change is represents a major change in functionality or
an addition of a major new feature. A minor version change represent
minor features and improvement along with bug fixes. A patch release is
done only for bug fixes and needed improvements to existing features.

The REST API versioning follows <http://semver.org/> where major version
represents incompatible API changes. The REST endpoints include a
version number which represents the major version. The version in the
URL doesn't change with minor versions. However, the API follows with
the version of the application.

## 1.11 Licensing

The project as a whole (front-end and server code) is GPL V3 but, individual parts may use compatible licenses. This is in compliance with the licensing.  Mark UI code that uses EXT JS with the GPL header.  Mark server code and other code as Apache V2. See NOTICE.txt for more information.  Our goal is allow for broader usage when other requirements are met.  This also clarifies how individual pieces can be used.

## 1.12 Security

Openstorefront support several environments each have different security needs.
It also support a built in user management.  Regardless of the authentication mechanism the security is based on dynamic role made up of permissions.

The granularity of the permissions is mostly feature/tool based.  

### 1.12.1 Adding Permissions

1. Add Permission to SecurityPermission entity in code.

2. Add Permission to auto-generated admin group (See Core-Service-> ...core.init.SecurityInit.java)

3. Apply Permission


Two place where permission need to be applied:

- Server API

- UI (typically to restrict a page however, it may be used to restrict a piece of functionality)

Use caution in marking APIs as there may be other features that rely a shared API to work correctly. Should be a rare case.
Also, keep in mind there may be special handling for "owners" of the data beyond a permission.


### 1.12.2 Data Restriction

Data may be restricted by source and/or data sensitivity.  Data sensitivity may 
be marked at a entity-level however, not all entity need to be marked. Marking
support on the UI may be set according to needs.

All Data-based API need to handling filtering data.


# 2. External Developers

This guide is targeted at external developers who want to extend the application.

## 2.1 REST API

The API document is directly reflected from the live code so it is always current for the running version of the application.
The API documentation can be accessed by logging in as an admin and following the link from the admin tools see application management.
A print view of the API can be generated form there as well.

## 2.2 Adding Custom Parser (Plugin)

A custom parser may be needed for handling complex formats that can't be support via data mapping.
In some cases, both a custom parser and data mapping may be required.

1 - Create an OSGi bundle (you use a maven project)

2 - Add a dependency to openstorefront-core-api

3 - In the Activator.java, register your new parser
   (More than one parser can be added to a plugin)

In start bundle:

```java
FileFormat customFormat = new FileFormat();
customFormat.setCode("CUSTOMFORMATCODE");
customFormat.setFileType(FileType.COMPONENT);
customFormat.setDescription("Custom format");
customFormat.setSupportsDataMap(true);  //Set to true to allow data mapping
customFormat.setParserClass(CustomParser.class.getName());

service.getImportService().registerFormat(customFormat, CustomParser.class);
```

In stop bundle:

```java
service.getImportService().unregisterFormat(customFormat.class.getName());
```

4 - Upload build JAR using the Admin->Application Management->System->Plugins
or copy jar to /var/openstorefront/perm/plugins and the application will auto-deploy

{{% notice note %}}
Only Libraries and API the application expose are available. (CORE-API, CORE-COMMON)
All other third-party libraries must be included with your JAR.
{{% /notice %}}

### 2.2.2 Parser Workflow

(Default flow but it can be overridden)

1. Check Format (On Web Upload)

2. Process Data

    1. Get the parser Reader (CSV, Text, XML...etc)

    2. Read Record

    3. Validate Record

    4. Add record to storage batch (flushes batch if full)

    5. Loop through remaining records

    6. Flush any records not stored

    7. Finish Processing (Override for special handling; Eg Media and Relationships)


### 2.2.3 Parser Class

1. Extend Either the Component or Attribute Base Parser
2. Implement Check format and parse record
    - Override other method such as getReader as needed.
    - The parse record method receive a model according to the reader.
    - Then it should return a record such as ComponentAll to be stored.
    - If the method return null it will skip the record.

{{% notice note %}}
The developer has access to the filehistory record and the service proxy.

**See:** spoon importer plugin as a example.

# 3. Database Management

The application handles all database interaction transparently, so
direct database access and manipulation is not needed.  

See the following for information on outside control (should rarely be
needed/used).

## 3.1 Refreshing the Database

{{% alert theme="danger" %}}
**CAUTION** This will wipe out all data in the application. Data, such
as User profiles, cannot be recovered. Component user data can be
preserved by performing an export from the component admin tool.
{{% /alert %}}

Make a backup by copying all of the files in the /var/openstorefront/db
directory or use the following console tools steps:

1.  Stop the Tomcat server  (e.g. service tomcat stop)
2.  Remove the folder /var/openstorefront/db (rm -rf /var/openstorefront/db)
3.  Start the tomcat server

When the application loads it will create a new database and populate
the data from whatever is currently in the import folders (lookups only; attributes, component, articles will need to be manually
trigger or uploaded via the Admin Tools UI).

The initial load of the application may take a few minutes. If the
import directories are empty, the application will load default lookup
files that are packaged with the application.

## 3.2 Installing Database Console

{{% notice warning %}}
Viewing (Querying) information is fine; however, use
extreme caution when modifying any records as all logic is handled by
the application.
{{% /notice %}}

1.  Download Orient DB (Currently using the 2.1.x series) at
    [OrientDB.org](http://www.orientechnologies.com/download/)

2.  Extract the archive

3.  Run the console ./bin/console.sh 

4.  Connect to the DB: 

connect remote: localhost/openstorefront (user) (password) (see the
    /var/openstorefront/config/openstorefront.properties for
    connection information)

The database supports an SQL like interface and then adds other
functionality on top.

-   See [Orient DB Backup](http://www.orientechnologies.com/docs/last/orientdb.wiki/Backup-and-Restore.html) for
    information about backup

-   See [Orient DB Export/Import](http://www.orientechnologies.com/docs/last/orientdb.wiki/Export-and-Import.html) for
    export and imports.

## 3.3 Installing Database Studio

{{% notice note %}}
Orient DB includes a web application for viewing the database
visually, instead of viewing everything from the console. Once installed,
Orient DB Studio will run with the database itself once OpenStoreFront 
is running, and will not require anything to be run locally
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
Viewing (Querying) information is fine; however, use
extreme caution when modifying any records as all logic is handled by
the application.
{{% /notice %}}

1.  Download Orient DB (Currently using the 2.1.x series) at
    [OrientDB.org](http://www.orientechnologies.com/download/)

  1. If you already downloaded Orient DB in section 3.2 above,
    you may simply reuse that download.

2.  Extract the archive

3.  Locate the Studio plugin: ./plugins/studio-2.1.zip

4.  Copy plugin to OpenStoreFront database on server:
    /var/openstorefront/db/plugins

  1. Copy entire .zip file; do not extract.

5. Start or Restart OpenStoreFront

  1. Plugin will automatically be installed when the database service
        is initialized.

6. Access Orient DB Studio: <http://localhost:2480/studio/index.html>

  1. Change 'localhost' to the appropriate domain name or IP address if OpenStoreFront is not running locally
  2. Ensure 'openstorefront' is selected as the database in the dropdown.
  3. Login using the credentials located in the configuration file: /var/openstorefront/config/openstorefront.properties

The database supports an SQL like interface and then adds other
functionality on top.

-   See [Orient DB Studio](http://orientdb.com/docs/2.1.x/Home-page.html) for
    more information about Studio



## 3.4 Aerospace Import istructions

1. Go to https://desktop.pingone.com/Aerospace
  1. Sign in with the proper credentials. If you don't have credentials find someone who does so that they can get you access.

2. Once you are logged in click on the NASAS3VI Image/Link and verify with MFA to get to the data page.

3. On that page click on the Datasets link in the top left hand corner, select SmallSatelliteProducts, select the appropriate month data type and download the zipped directory.

4. In general a few things need to happen here. We need to prepare a directory to feed to the aerospace importer on spoonsite.
  1. We only need the updated xml file. This file will be a few hundred KiloBytes large. The complete data set file is not needed it is about 4.6 MB.
  2. In addition to the update xml file we also need the provenance documents directory (if it is supplied) and the product images directory (if it is supplied).
  3. In order to preprocess the data, we need to run a python script that is located spoon\server\openstorefront\openstorefront-plugin\aerospaceimport\scripts\parse.py.
  Using this script you can fill in missing organizations as appropriate, remove escape characters and verify the entry types are complete.
  4. Once the xml file is ready it needs to be renamed to "recordsList.xml" (without quotes) the product_images folder must be named "product_images" (without quotes).
  5. Once those 3 files are ready, they should be zipped up into a directory and now they are ready to be imported.

5. On spoonsite, go to admin->data management->imports. Fill in the required information, provide the appropriate mapping file and select import.
6. You are done, after a period of time the import will bring in the appropriate data and the entries.
