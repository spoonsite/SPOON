**Question**

Do sub-sections save independent of other sub-sections?

**Answer**

Section (Eg. Architecture) may be broken in multiple sub-section.  Saving save all
sub-sections.   So if your are edit more than one on multiple browser tabs. 
Keep in mind you changes will override changes in another tab.  It's recommended 
to only edit in one browser tab and one browser at a time.  Use change history
to find resolve previous issues.

**Question**

What's the difference between in Entry and Evaluation?  

**Answer**

An entry is like an abstract of listing item. An entry can have multiple evaluations.
Think about it this way.  Microsoft Produces a product call Word.   The entry is would be about Word and not
a specific version.  The evaluation however is about a specific version.  
Eg. Evaluating Word 2016 and this the installation, test, architecture and checklist
for that version.

As an evaluator, it expected that they will update the entry as needed to 
describe the product.  (It contacts, the general description, resources...where to download..etc)
That entry updated by the evaluator upon publish are incorporated into the entry.
With the evaluation being the version specific information.  Use the Evaluation summary
to describe the product from the evaluator experience.  Eg. Was is easy to use? Was the support responsive? etc.
